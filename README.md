### üìù **Project Description: Weather Data Visualization using Python**

This Python-based mini project demonstrates a foundational yet insightful implementation of **data visualization** techniques applied to weather data across five major Indian cities ‚Äî **Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata**. It is a part of **Task 1** under the internship program at **Codetech IT Solutions**, carried out by **Rishan N**, a student of **Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology**.

The primary objective of this project is to build a **visual dashboard** that represents real-world data in a meaningful, intuitive, and engaging format. Due to limitations in mobile or restricted environments where direct API calls are not feasible, the script uses **offline static sample data** that mimics typical weather information such as temperature, humidity, and general conditions like clear skies, clouds, or rain.

The project employs two powerful libraries in Python ‚Äî **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** ‚Äî to create visually appealing graphs:

1. **Bar Plot ‚Äì Temperature Comparison:**
   This graph compares the average temperature (in Celsius) across the five selected cities. It uses a color-coded bar plot where each city is visually distinct, and temperature values are annotated for quick understanding. It helps identify hotter regions like Delhi and Chennai at a glance.

2. **Line Plot ‚Äì Humidity Levels:**
   This line graph tracks the relative humidity percentage in each city. It highlights cities with high moisture levels like Mumbai and Bangalore, giving a visual sense of the environmental comfort or discomfort levels.

3. **Pie Chart ‚Äì Weather Condition Distribution:**
   This pie chart visualizes the proportion of general weather conditions across the dataset. It helps summarize how many cities experienced "Clear," "Clouds," or "Rain" conditions, showing diversity in weather even within a short list.

The script is organized, cleanly documented, and beginner-friendly, making it a perfect example for aspiring data scientists or interns learning how to work with real-world datasets and presenting them through professional-quality visuals.

In conclusion, this task not only demonstrates Rishan‚Äôs ability to use Python for visualization but also reflects key programming skills, attention to detail, and an understanding of data interpretation. The project lays the foundation for more advanced applications, including API integration, live weather data collection, or dashboard deployment in future tasks.
